# ORM:
------

-> An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational 
   database tables into objects that are adopted in application code.
   
-> ORMs offer a high-level abstraction upon a relational database, which permits a developer to write Python code 
   rather than SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database.   
   
# Sample ORM Query:
-------------------
   Eg-1: SQL statement used to retrieve employees whose income is 10,000.00.
   SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE INCOME=10000.00
   
   Eg-2: The equivalent Django ORM query is
   emps = Employee.objects.filter(income=10000.00)
   
   -> Such an ability to write Python code instead of SQL speeds up web application development.
